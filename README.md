# SpringJWTAuthExample
Example project for handling JWTs using Spring Security and 
MySQL for storing encrypted credentials. The schema is set for
``create-drop`` so you don't have to create a schema before
running the application.

### Postman Collection
I also added the ``SpringJWTAuthExample.postman_collection.json`` file 
for testing.
